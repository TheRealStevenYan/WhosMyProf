# Who's My Prof?

---

Ever got tired of constantly checking out a professor's ratings whenever you were interested in a specific course?

No longer will this be an issue with this upcoming Google Chrome extension.
It will automatically detect and place a UBC professor's RateMyProfessors rating onto the course selection webpage, 
so you don't have to do the busy work.

Coming soon!
## TODO:

- Finish implementing requests - requesting things from ratemyprofessors.com leads to a CORS error. Implement a proxy to fix this.
- Scraping from RMP once the requests are done
- Detection of professors from course selection page (Only detects course webpage at the moment, not selection page)
- Beautify the code
